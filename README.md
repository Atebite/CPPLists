## C++ Lists

*NOTE: This is unfinished!*

An implementation of C#-like Lists in C++, essentially a dynamically resizing array.

See wiki for documentation.

*NOTE: This is complete shit!*

This is my first C++ project, and is more likely than not riddled with horrible code making you want to commit suicide. Don't blame me, I don't know any better yet.
