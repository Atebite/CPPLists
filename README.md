## C++ Lists

**NOTE: This is unfinished!**

### What

An implementation of C#-like Lists in C++, essentially a dynamically resizing array.

### Why

"Why not just use vector? Or the list class provided by the standard library?"

Because I'm a fucking retard (by not realizing I could have) and I wanted a challenge. Besides, who wants the ugly function names that vectors have?

### How

By giving the class a dynamic memory array, you can remake the array each time a value is added or removed with a new size, essentially making it resize dynamically.

Or, in other words, by completely fucking up the use of dynamic memory allocation for arrays and creating an abomination.

### Other

See wiki for documentation.

**NOTE: This is complete shit!**

This is my first C++ project, and is more likely than not riddled with horrible code making you want to commit suicide. Don't blame me, I don't know any better yet.
